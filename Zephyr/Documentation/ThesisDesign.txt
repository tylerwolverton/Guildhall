out param design

function call needs to know which params are out

function definition could just save all params back, but probably nice to say out in script

function call
- function is called
- event args contain out variables
- put those values into corresponding identifiers in normal variable way to support local, state, global etc.
- 


function definition bytecode
- do function
- save values of out vars into event args that was passed in since they will survive the call


----------------
Initialization of entities
- Create all entities in game
  - Initialize each zephyr script object
  ^ could be interleaved without issue
- Wire up all entity references

-Call spawned for each entity in order of map definition

only parentEntity can be accessed at global scope, trying to access any other entity should error since initialization order isn't guaranteed
everything should be available when Spawned is called
