Walking through portal to room map that failed to load still teleports to position
Warn in console when using a tileType in map that doesn't exist in TileDefs

Params in timer functions


out needs to be specified on function definition (GameAPI can know which vars are out)
save the out vars into event args with & preface
call function in VM needs to check event args after and upon finding an & try to save the value for that into the current chunk
Don't support out variables as members like (out entity.val)

Parse and make sure the only thing after out param is identifier
function call may need a signifier too so parser knows how to check

Isaiah

parameter name a little confusing
pos corresponds to tile, add .5 behind the scenes
yaw?
ScriptVarInit -> Var
+=
case sensitive in xml :(

Projectile hardcodes attack damage!!!!!!!!

health and other built in entity vars exposed and/or a way to affect health from script 

Use parentEntity in global inits and Spawned

can't use parentheses in parameter :(
can't use - in parameters

--------- Final Thoughts
intuitive, liked it
would use it :D
case insensitive



---------------------------
Arthur

case sensitivity - consistent is okay

F5 while in dialog doesn't end dialogue

Can't access entity after dead

Spawning onto dead things will collide with the corpse briefly

Can get into bad state while adding code live. Tried to add new spawning and coouldn't
Why kill all entities when map destroyed? -> causes errors if you spawn entities on death

really cool, and easy to use
could figure it out by skimming

global functions are called on every instance of the script object, not just the one who defined it, so using member variables in global functions is unsafe. This is needed to support script to script communication though
could replace the global functions with calls to entity functions directly for script to script
