Known Issues
- None

How to Use
- Run Starship_x64 to start the game. 

Keyboard
- 'w' or up arrow gives the player ship acceleration
- left and right arrow keys and 'a' and 'd' keys will turn the ship left or right respectively. The ship will not turn if both are held
- Spacebar fires bullets when pressed (will only fire one bullet per key down and release)
- 'n' will respawn the player ship (only when player is dead)
- 'F1' will turn on debug draw mode
- 'F8' will restart the game
- 'o' will spawn more asteroids
- 'p' will pause the game
- 't' will enter slowmo 
- Shift will fire a Starburst shot (only when not on a cooldown)
- the game can be exited by 'esc' as well as your favorite method to close a standard windows application (alt+f4, x button in corner, etc.).

Controller 
- left stick will turn ship and apply thrust
- 'A' button fires a bullet
- 'X' button fires Starburst shot (only when not on cooldown)
- 'Start' will respawn the player ship (only when player is dead)

The game can be started by pressing space, n, or the start button on the controller when in attract mode (only the logo is shown on screen)

Deep Learning
- Working on this project showed me the value of quick iteration time and a clean, easy to navigate codebase. I tried to use hotkeys and solve the basic version of a problem first before trying to engineer a more complicated solution and found I was able to work through the assignment requirements very quickly. Seeing progress so quickly boosted my motivation and helped me to feel more confident about my ability to finish the project since I was able to get into the tougher parts of the assignment more quickly. I also refactored a couple of times during the course of the project which made future workmuch faster and easier. Near the end I decided to do another round of refactoring and was initially worried I wouldn't have time to do Starburst, but it turned out I could implement the entire feature in about 45 min after my code was clean. This resulted in me having both the extra feature and an organized codebase. Going forward I'm definitely going to dedicate time to refactoring my code as I go instead of waiting until the very end as well as continuing to practice hot keys. Clean code removes a lot of extra brain processing, clearing the way to work on the interesting parts of a project.
