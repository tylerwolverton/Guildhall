Deep Learning
- While this project went pretty quickly, I did notice an area I could improve upon in the future. Having had some experience with writing a vector class in an earlier project, I quickly glanced at the header and then started right in on the functions. When writing the first method that required the use of the member variables x and y I initially wrote the code "this.x" since that was how I had accessed the members of my vector class in the past. Had I taken the time to read the project more carefully I would have seen that we were given a struct and the access pattern was different. This mistake only cost me a couple of minutes but in future projects diving into the code too quickly could cost me a lot of wasted time and effort, so in the future I plan to read the project description and starter code more carefully and slow down as I design my solution.
