Deep Learning
- While working on this assigment (along with the remaining math assignments) I was interested to find out about the range of implementations other students did for various features. I learned a lot just from discussing my approaches with others, sometimes going back and changing what I had done after hearing about a better approach. After learning so much from these discussions I'm going to try to talk with the other SDs more on future projects (never actually sharing code of course) to compare and contrast different ways to solve problems.
